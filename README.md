#MVC Messenger
Built to give an idea on the following topics:
1. Decoupling between Model, View, Controller.
2. Undo manager, actions, edits, etc.
3. (not implemented yet) Exception handling in MVC.
4. (not implemented yet) Alternative to deprecated observer

Due to time constraints, the code quality is not the best,
and many features may not be fully functional. However it should 
provide a decent starting point.
